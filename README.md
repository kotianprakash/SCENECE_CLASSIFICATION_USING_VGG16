# Scene Classification using VGG16
Introduction
This project aims to classify images of natural scenes into different categories using the VGG16 neural network architecture. The idea is to train a model that can accurately classify images of natural scenes based on their visual features.




The program will load the scene dataset and split it into training and testing sets.

The program will then train a VGG16 model on the training set.
After training, the program will evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set.

The program will display the accuracy and loss values for the model.

The program will also display a few sample images from the testing set along with their predicted classes.

# Algorithm
The algorithm used to classify natural scenes into different categories is based on VGG16. Here's how it works:

The program reads in images of natural scenes from the scene dataset.

The program applies various image processing techniques to enhance the features of the images.

The program trains a VGG16 model on the training set to learn the features of different natural scenes.

The program evaluates the performance of the model on the testing set by comparing its predictions with the true labels of the images.

The program uses the trained model to predict the categories of sample images from the testing set.

# Conclusion
Scene classification using VGG16 is a powerful technique for automatically classifying images of natural scenes. This project demonstrates how VGG16 can be used to learn the features of different natural scenes and accurately classify them into different categories. With further development and refinement, this technique could be used in real-world applications such as environmental monitoring or landscape photography.
